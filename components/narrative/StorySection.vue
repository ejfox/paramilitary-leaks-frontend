          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">
            Following the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot, a wilderness survival trainer named John Williams made an
            extraordinary decision.
            Outraged by what he witnessed, he embarked on a years-long, self-directed mission to infiltrate the most
            prominent right-wing
            militias in America. Unlike typical informants, Williams acted alone - he didn't tell police or the FBI,
            his family or friends.
            The only person he eventually confided in was a ProPublica reporter.

                few hundred dollars cash; makeshift disguises and lock-picking gear; medical supplies, vitamins and
                high-calorie energy gels; and thumb drives that each held more than 100 gigabytes of encrypted
                documents, which he would quickly distribute if he were about to be arrested or killed."

          </div>

          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">
            As Williams climbed the ranks of both the Oath Keepers and American Patriots Three Percent (AP3/APIII)
            militias,
            he meticulously documented everything. In what became one of the most comprehensive datasets ever compiled
            on American militia groups,
            he captured over 140,000 private messages, thousands of photos and videos, and dozens of voice recordings
            that
            revealed the inner workings of these secretive organizations.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">
            What makes this dataset unique is that it captures real-time communications that militia members believed
            were completely secure.
            These weren't public statements or carefully crafted press releases - they were candid conversations
            between people who believed
            they were speaking only to trusted comrades.

        <div class="prose prose-xl prose-invert mx-auto text-gray-200">
          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">
            The leaked dataset has enabled journalists to expose concrete schemes and operations that would have
            otherwise remained hidden.
            Among the most striking revelations was how the American Patriots III% militia attempted to establish a
            fake nonprofit called
            American Community Outreach Network (ACON) as a front to fund their operations and personally enrich
            members.

          <div class="mb-8 pl-8 border-l-4 border-blue-500 italic bg-gray-900/70 pt-4 rounded-r-lg">
            <p class="text-xl text-gray-300">"We're giving a 20 percent kickback to everyone," APIII founder Scot Seddon
              said
              in voice messages captured in the data. "Anybody that gets money coming through, donated to us, is going
              to receive 20 percent off the top. So if you raise ten thousand dollars, you're gonna get two grand and
              that's gonna go directly to you."</p>
            <p class="text-4xl text-blue-400 pb-8">"I want us all to be fucking rich."</p>
          </div>



          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">
            But Williams' infiltration revealed much more than just financial schemes. His documentation showed how
            militias were actively recruiting law enforcement officers, conducting surveillance on journalists, and
            developing plans for various contingencies including civil unrest. By November 2022, as Williams continued
            gathering evidence, paranoia had set in among the militia leadership.

                Seddon, the AP3 founder, said in a private message. "Fucking trust nobody. There's fucking turncoats
                everywhere."

            Ultimately, Williams had to flee when he feared his cover might be blown. In April 2023, he grabbed his
            pre-packed emergency backpack and mailed a flash drive containing his evidence to a journalist. That
            decision to make the data public has fundamentally changed how we understand these organizations.

            This leaked dataset has become an invaluable resource for journalists, researchers, and potentially law
            enforcement. It has led to concrete reporting on militia activities that was previously impossible, and
            continues to yield new insights into how these groups operate, communicate, and recruit.
